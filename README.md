      9. Reverse the string

17. Given two ordered arrays of integers, write a program to merge the two-arrays to get an ordered array.
18. WAP to display Fibonacci series (i)using recursion, (ii) using iteration
19. WAP to calculate Factorial of a number (i)using recursion, (ii) using iteration 
20. WAP to calculate GCD of two numbers (i) with recursion (ii) without recursion.

21. Create Matrix class using templates. Write a menu-driven program to perform following Matrix operations (2-D array implementation):
       1. Sum b) Difference c) Product d) Transpose
22. Create the Person class. Create some objects of this class (by taking information from the user). Inherit the class Person to create two classes Teacher and Student class. Maintain the respective information in the classes and create, display and delete objects of these two classes (Use Runtime Polymorphism).
23. Create a class Triangle. Include overloaded functions for calculating area. Overload assignment operator and equality operator.
24. Create a class Box containing length, breath and height. Include following methods in it: a) Calculate surface Area
      1. Calculate Volume
      2. Increment, Overload ++ operator (both prefix & postfix)
      3. Decrement, Overload -- operator (both prefix & postfix)
      4. Overload operator == (to check equality of two boxes), as a friend function
      5. Overload Assignment operator
      6. Check if it is a Cube or cuboid
       Write a program which takes input from the user for length, breath and height to test the above class.

25. Create a structure Student containing fields for Roll No., Name, Class, Year and Total Marks. Create 10 students and store them in a file.
26. Write a program to retrieve the student information from file created in previous question and print it in following format:
    Roll No. Name Marks

27. Copy the contents of one text file to another file, after removing all whitespaces.
28. Write a function that reverses the elements of an array in place. The function must accept only one pointer value and return void.
29. Write a program that will read 10 integers from user and store them in an array. Implement array using pointers. The program will print the array elements in ascending and descending order.
